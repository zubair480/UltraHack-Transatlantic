## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Smart Safety Management System (SSMS) to improve worker accountability, safety, and efficiency in manufacturing industries. The system will leverage the capabilities of the Oak D camera to monitor worker activities, attendance, and adherence to safety protocols, providing real-time data and notifications to the head department and controller office, while also generating automated inquiries to employees and enabling swift action in case of outsiders detected.

## Key Features

- Integration with wearable safety gear: The SSMS will work in conjunction with wearable safety gear, such as helmets, gloves, and vests, to ensure employee safety and adherence to protocols.
- Real-time monitoring and data collection: The Oak D camera will provide continuous monitoring of employees, capturing images and data on their activities, attendance, and compliance with safety protocols.
- Automated notifications, inquiries, and alerts: The system will generate emails to the controller office in case of any discrepancies or safety breaches, including incomplete safety gear or unauthorized personnel. The controller's system will then automatically send an inquiry to the employee, requiring a response. In case of outsider detection, the controller room management will take immediate action.
- Entrance point monitoring: The Oak D camera will capture images of every individual passing through the facility's entrance point for added security and record-keeping.
- Scalability: The SSMS can be scaled up or down to accommodate different manufacturing facilities and varying levels of worker activity.

## Project Overview

The SSMS will integrate the Oak D camera with wearable safety gear for seamless monitoring of workers within the manufacturing facility. The system will detect employees wearing safety gear and ensure its completeness. If the safety gear is incomplete or absent, the system will generate an email to the controller and notify them about the employee. In cases where no safety gear is detected, the system will assume the individual is an outsider and notify the controller accordingly.

Upon receiving notifications, the controller's system will generate an automatic inquiry to the employee, requiring them to submit an answer appeal in response to the inquiry. Meanwhile, if an outsider is detected, the controller room management will take immediate action.

The Oak D camera will also capture images of every person passing through the entrance point, and the system will generate emails with relevant pictures for record-keeping purposes.
